        <p className="text-gray-400 ">
        I was born in Hof, Germany and was always fascinated by my dad’s and my brother’s PCs when I was young. As soon as I got my own computer, I quickly got 
        into gaming — which eventually sparked my interest in programming and computer science.

        I started my bachelor’s degree in computer science in Hof in 2020 and finished it in February 2025. 
        I’m now looking for new opportunities to prove myself and grow.

        I’m especially interested in AI, machine learning, and software development with Java or Python. I enjoy building practical
        apps — tools I can use myself or share with friends — and I’m always excited to take on creative and meaningful projects.
